#In this file you can define which blocks are safe and which are not.
#Remember that there are a few immutable rules, that are stronger than those specified in this file.
#For example, the block on which player will be reborn, must be obsidian and above it must be a minimum of 3 blocks of air.
#In addition under the block of obsidian cannot be a block of air.

#Here you can define safe blocks. They can be near vwarp. It's something like white-list.
#It will be good (for you) if you write them in ascending order.
